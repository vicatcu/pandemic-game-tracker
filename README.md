## Build once using web technologies and deploy everywhere!

Polyonic is an Electron Ionic application shell for creating Web Apps, Progressive Mobile Web Apps, Native Mobile Apps and Desktop Apps.

This project combines the [Electron Framework](http://electron.atom.io/) with the [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) and provides a starter for building out an app that can run on either the desktop (macOS, Windows and Linux), a browser or mobile devices (iOS and Android).  You can use this application to build and run on one or all of these platforms.

## Motivation

When working in small teams creating web and mobile applications, it is difficult and time consuming for new team members to pick up the different technologies for each platform. I have also been asked a few questions that motivated me to try Polyonic out:

- Is there a way to run this mobile app on the desktop?
- Can we cache more in the browser for offline working?
- Can we have one Universal app that can run on the desktop, mobile, web and Office 365?

These questions made me think about the limitations of the browser for off-line editing and caching and was there a way to create a package that can be used to flesh out any app we require, whilst reducing the overhead of having to learn numerous libraries and frameworks for each platform.

And that is why I decided to try combining Electron and Ionic. Is it wise to have a universal app using a mobile framework? Probably not, but it is fun :wink:

## Quick start

The dependencies for this project are [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).

You will need the latest Node 10 LTS and NPM 6+ installed.

Make sure you have [node installed and running](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then install Ionic and Cordova globally using npm.

```node
npm install -g ionic@latest cordova@latest
```

Clone the repo, change into the Polyonic directory, install the npm packages and run the Electron app

```node
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/paulsutherland/Polyonic
cd Polyonic

npm install
npm run electron:dev
```

You now have Electron and Ionic running as a Desktop app.

## Running live reload for development

When developing, you will want to have the app live reload as you save your changes.

### Desktop

```node
npm run electron:dev
```

For debugging the main process you will need to have the Chrome Browser installed.

```node
npm run electron:dev:debug
```

Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://inspect/ and select the Electron remote target that is available to attach the debugger to.

If you require live reloading of the main process debugging session, then it is recommended that you install the Chrome plugin [Node.js V8 --inspector Manager (NiM)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nodejs-v8-inspector-manag/gnhhdgbaldcilmgcpfddgdbkhjohddkj?hl=en). In the plugin settings, set the host to localhost, the port to 9229 and the app to auto.  This will allow you to live reload changes made to the main process (electron.js file).

```node
npm run electron:dev:debug-live
```

### iOS

#### Emulator

```node
npm run emulate:ios-dev
```

#### Device

```node
npm run device:ios-dev
```

### Android

#### Emulator

```node
npm run emulate:android-dev
```

#### Device

```node
npm run device:android-dev
```

## Building on Windows

For building on Windows you will need to install the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System.

You can [download NSIS here](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page)

You will need to make sure the NSIS path is added as an environment variable:

```node
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS"
```

Or using [point and click](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page).

## Porting existing Ionic Apps

It is possible to port your existing apps to run on the desktop, but you may need to make some platform adjustments to call out to an equivalent api for any mobile plugins your app uses.  The app makes use of the [ngx-electron module](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/ngx-electron) for Angular which makes is easy to call the Electron APIs from within the Ionic components.

For example you may want to check what platform you are running on before you make an api call, either calling out to an Ionic plugin, an Electron api  or a browser api.  

The data service component ```data.service.ts``` has an example of setting up a PouchDB database depending upon what platform the app is running on.  

```javascript
import { ElectronService } from 'ngx-electron'
import { Platform, Events } from '@ionic/angular'
...

constructor(public electron: ElectronService, private platform: Platform, private events: Events) {}
...

public setup() {
    const ctx = this
    console.log('Setting up the application database')

    if (ctx.electron.isElectronApp) {
      return ctx.desktopDB()
    }
    if (ctx.platform.is('mobile')) {
      return ctx.mobileDB()
    } else {
      return ctx.webDB()
    }
}

```

## Encryption at rest

If your app requires your data to be encrypted at rest, the app includes an example of using the [cordova-sqlcipher-adapter](https://github.com/brodybits/cordova-sqlcipher-adapter) plugin for Ionic and the [polyonic-secure-pouch](https://github.com/paulsutherland/polyonic-secure-pouch) plugin for the desktop and browser.

The Cordova example encrypts the local sqlite database, whereas the secure pouch plugin encrypts and decrypts your data when it is saved or fetched from the browser database. Either way, at rest, your data is encrypted.

You will need to include a key or password/secret from the user, or an api app, to encrypt the data.  You can store this key in [Ionic Secure Storage](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/secure-storage/) or for the desktop you can use [Keytar](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar).

## Ionic App Flow

When using [Ionic App Flow](https://ionicframework.com/docs/appflow/quickstart/installation) and the ```cordova-plugin-ionic``` plugin, you may experience the app hanging on start-up whilst developing your apps in live-reload. To prevent this, the app uses a script to disable deploy in the ```config.xml``` file in development mode.  It then then uses a pre-commit hook to enable it when checking into git.

Using the above npm commands will make sure you don't run into issues with Ioinc App Flow.
